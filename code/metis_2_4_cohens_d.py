'''
Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. 
Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. 
How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

    Computes Cohen's d for the two groups.
    Cohen's d is a test statistic measuring the difference in means as a 
    proportion of the pooled standard deviation.

    cohens_d = abs(mean1 - mean2)/np.sqrt(pooled_var)

preg_length = cohens_d(first.prglngth, others.prglngth)

# Cohen's d for Total Weight
